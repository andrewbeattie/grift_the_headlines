# Day 6 Riffed From The Headlines Scraper

## Overview

Growing up I always wanted just one thing and that was a Day6 tote bag. While I listened and tried my luck I was never quite able to achieve my end goal. Now older and more experienced, battle harded having experienced the horrors of shoe botting and the rise of AI I fell into temptation and started down the path to the dark side. This project is designed to extract the information required to create what I need to finally get my hands on a tote bag. This script can be run to create a dataset made up of the "Riffed From The Headlines" quiz on CBC's Day 6. This is implemented using Python3 using BeautifulSoup, locally I have setup a pipeline using Airflow to run the script on a schedule pulling data every week.
